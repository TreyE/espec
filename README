===== ESpec =====
(C) 2008-2009 Lewis R. Evans IV

A more sensible unit testing framework for erlang.

First and foremost, it's important to note that this uses Erlware.org's Sinan,
so if you want to be able to build/install it, you will need Faxien and Sinan
installed.

Mainly, once you've built and installed the release, you should be able to
run ESpec on any of your projects by simply changing to the project's directory and running the 'espec' command.

=== How does this differ from EUnit? ===

Without going into the details of the new testing macros and functionality
provided, what ESpec mainly does is separate your tests from your production
code, allowing you to now have test suites that don't need to be embedded in
the module you're testing.  This allows you to test as a client of the module,
evaluating the behaviour of it's interface - rather than testing it's internal
functions.  This is a major point of good TDD - it forces you to create code
that is not a tangled mess of dependencies.

=== How do I write a new test? ===

You write tests on an app-by-app basis.  Sinan already divides your release into different applications (usually in the 'lib' dir of your project).  In each applications directory you have the usual folders: 'ebin', 'include', 'src', etc.
All you need to do is create a new directory called 'test', and put your test modules in it.  Make sure your test modules include 'espec.hrl' - and that's it - espec will do the rest.
